Welcome to your GitHub repository! This is a Next.js project using TypeScript, specifically designed for building simplified management applications. The main goal of the project is to provide convenience in developing management applications with a focus on functionality rather than complex interfaces.

The project offers a collection of specialized components tailored for this type of application. The two most important components are the "searchable-container" and the "maintain-container." These core components make it easier to create functional screens within your application.

The ultimate aim of the project is to enable developers to simply write a JSON configuration file and effortlessly generate desired functional screens. By doing so, your project promises to save time and effort for developers, allowing them to focus on application logic and functionality instead of building interfaces from scratch.

If you're interested in developing efficient yet straightforward management applications, your project serves as a valuable resource to reference. You can explore your GitHub repository to learn more and discover the useful features it offers. Embrace the potential of your project and leverage it to build remarkable management applications!
