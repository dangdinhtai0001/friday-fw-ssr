## useDatasource

### Objective
The useDatasource function is a custom hook that fetches data from a specified URL using Axios and returns the data along with the SWRResponse object. The main objective of this function is to optimize performance by using useMemo to avoid calling the useSWR hook unnecessarily.

### Inputs:
- IDatasourceProps: an interface that defines the properties of the data source, including the URL, fetcher options, SWR options, and functions to transform data and errors.

### Flow:
1. Destructure the properties from the input parameter.
2. Define a fetcher function that uses Axios to fetch data from the specified URL and transform the data if a transformData function is provided.
3. Use useMemo to memoize the SWR options and avoid unnecessary calls to the useSWR hook.
4. Return the result of calling the useSWR hook with the URL, fetcher function, and memoized SWR options.

### Outputs:
- IDatasourceReturn: an interface that extends the SWRResponse object and includes the fetched data.

### Additional aspects:
- The fetcher function can throw an error if an error occurs during the fetch.
- The useDatasource function can be used to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary calls to the useSWR hook.
